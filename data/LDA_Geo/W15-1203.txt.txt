The role of personality , age , and gender in tweeting about mental illness Mental illnesses , such as depression and post traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ), are highly underdiagnosed globally .
Populations sharing similar demographics and personality traits are known to be more at risk than others .
In this study , we characterise the language use of users disclosing their mental illness on Twitter .
Language - derived personality and demographic estimates show surprisingly strong performance in distinguishing users that tweet a diagnosis of depression or PTSD from random controls , reaching an area under the receiver - operating characteristic curve - AUC - of around .
8 in all our binary classification tasks .
In fact , when distinguishing users disclosing depression from those disclosing PTSD , the single feature of estimated age shows nearly as strong performance ( AUC = .
806 ) as using thousands of topics ( AUC = .
819 ) or tens of thousands of n - grams ( AUC = .
We also find that differential language analyses , controlled for demographics , recover many symptoms associated with the mental illnesses in the clinical literature .
1 Introduction Mental illnesses , such as depression and post traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) represent a large share of the global burden of disease ( Üstün et al ., 2004 ; Mathers and Loncar , 2006 ), but are underdiagnosed and undertreated around the world ( Prince et al ., 2007 ).
Previous research has demonstrated the important role of demographic factors in depression risk .
For example , while clinically - assessed depression is estimated at 6 . 6 % in a 12 - month interval for U . S . adults ( Kessler et al ., 2003 ), the prevalence in males is 3 - 5 %, while the prevalence is 8 - 10 % in females ( Andrade et al ., 2003 ).
Similarly , prevalence of PTSD among U . S . adults in any 12 - month period is estimated at 3 . 5 % ( Kessler et al ., 2005b ) - 1 . 8 % in males and 5 . 2 % in females - yet this risk is not distributed evenly across age groups ; prevalence of PTSD increases throughout the majority of the lifespan to reach a peak of 9 . 2 % between the ages of 49 - 59 , before dropping sharply to 2 . 5 % past the age of 60 .
Large scale user - generated content provides the opportunity to extract information not only about events , but also about the person posting them .
Using automatic methods , a wide set of user characteristics , such as age , gender , personality , location and income have been shown to be predictable from shared social media text .
The same holds for mental illnesses , from users expressing symptoms of their illness ( e . g .
low mood , focus on the self , high anxiety ) to talking about effects of their illness ( e . g .
mentioning medications and therapy ) and to even self - disclosing the illness .
This study represents an analysis of language use in users who share their mental illness though social media , in this case depression and PTSD .
We advocate adjusting for important underlying demographic factors , such as age and gender , to avoid confounding by language specific to these underlying characteristics .
The age and gender trends from the U . S . population are present in our dataset , although imperfectly , given the biases of self - reports and social media sampling .
Our differential language analyses show symptoms associated with these illnesses congruent with existing clinical theory and consequences of diagnoses .
In addition to age and gender , we focus on the important role of inferred personality in predicting mental illness .
We show that a model which uses only the text - predicted user level ' Big Five ' personality dimensions plus age and gender perform with high accuracy , comparable to methods that use standard dictionaries of psychology as features .
Users who self - report a diagnosis appear more neurotic and more introverted when compared to average users .
We use a dataset of Twitter users reported to suffer from a mental illness , specifically depression and post traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ).
This dataset was first introduced in ( Coppersmith et al ., 2014a ).
The self - reports are collected by searching a large Twitter archive for disclosures using a regular expression ( e . g .
' I have been diagnosed with depression ').
Candidate users were filtered manually and then all their most recent tweets have been continuously crawled using the Twitter Search API .
The self - disclosure messages were excluded from the dataset and from the estimation of user inferred demographics and personality scores .
The control users were selected at random from Twitter .
In total there are 370 users diagnosed only with PTSD , 483 only with depression and 1104 control users .
On average , each user has 3400 . 8 messages .
( 2014b ) acknowledge , this method of collection is susceptible to multiple biases , but represents a simple way to build a large dataset of users and their textual information .
3 Features We use the Twitter posts of a user to infer several user traits which we expect to be relevant to mental illnesses based on standard clinical criteria ( American Psychiatric Association , 2013 ).
Recently , automatic user profiling methods have used on user - generated text and complementary features in order to predict different user traits such as : age ( Nguyen et al ., 2011 ), gender ( Sap et al ., 2014 ), location ( Cheng et al ., 2010 ), impact ( Lampos et al ., 2014 ), political preference ( Volkova et al ., 2014 ), temporal orientation ( Schwartz et al ., 2015 ) or personality ( Schwartz et al ., 2013 ).
3 . 1 Age , Gender and Personality We use the methods developed in ( Schwartz et al ., 2013 ) to assign each user scores for age , gender and personality from the popular five factor model of personality - ' Big Five ' - ( McCrae and lohn , 1992 ), which consists of five dimensions : extraversion , agreeableness , conscientiousness , neuroticism and openness to experience .
The model was trained on a large sample of around 70 , 000 Facebook users who have taken Big Five personality tests and shared their posts using a model using 1 - 3 grams and topics as features ( Park et al ., 2014 ; Schwartz et al ., 2013 ).
This model achieves R > .
3 predictive performance for all five traits .
This dataset is also used to obtain age and gender adjusted personality and topic distributions .
3 . 2 Affect and Intensity Emotions play an important role in the diagnosis of mental illness ( American Psychiatric Association , 2013 ).
We aim to capture the expression of users ' emotions through their generated posts .
We characterize expressions along the dimensions of affect ( from positive to negative ) and intensity ( from low to high ), which correspond to the two primary axes of the circumplex model , a well - established system for describing emotional states ( Posner et al ., 2005 ).
Machine learning approaches perform significantly better at quantifying emotion / sentiment from text compared to lexicon - based methods ( Pang and Lee , 2008 ).
Emotions are expressed at message - level .
Consequently , we trained a text classification model on 3 , 000 Facebook posts labeled by affect and intensity using unigrams as features .
We applied this model on each user ' s posts and aggregated over them to obtain a user score for both dimensions .
3 . 3 Textual Features For our qualitative text analysis we extract textual features from all of a user ' s Twitter posts .
Traditional psychological studies use a closed - vocabulary approach to modelling text .
The most popular method is based on Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count ( LIWC ) ( Pennebaker et al ., 2001 ).
In LIWC , psychological theory was used to build 64 different categories .
These include different parts - of - speech , topical categories and emotions .
Each user is thereby represented as a distribution over these categories .
We also use all frequent 1 - 3 grams ( used by more than 10 % of users in our dataset ), where we use point - wise mutual information ( PMI ) to filter infrequent 2 - 3 grams .
For a better qualitative assessment and to reduce risk of overfitting , we use a set of topics as a form of dimensionality reduction .
We use the 2 , 000 clusters introduced in ( Schwartz et al ., 2013 ) obtained by applying Latent Dirichlet Allocation ( Blei et al ., 2003 ), the most popular topic model , to a large set of Facebook posts .
4 Prediction In this section we present an analysis of the predictive power of inferred user - level features .
We use the methods introduced in Section 3 to predict nine user level scores : age , gender , affect , intensity and the Big Five personality traits .
The three populations in our dataset are used to formulate three binary classification problems in order to analyse specific pairwise group peculiarities .
Users having both PTSD and depression are held - out when classifying between these two classes .
To assess the power of our text - derived features , we use as features broader textual features such as the LIWC categories , the LDA inferred topics and frequent 1 - 3 grams .
We train binary logistic regression classifiers ( Pe - dregosa et al ., 2011 ) with Elastic Net régularisation ( Zou and Hastie , 2005 ).
In Table 1 we report the performance using 10 - fold cross - validation .
Performance is measured using ROC area under the curve ( ROC AUC ), an adequate measure when the classes are imbalanced .
A more thorough study of predictive performance for identifying PTSD and depressed users is presented in ( Preotiuc - Pietro et al ., 2015 ).
Our results show the following : • Age alone improves over chance and is highly predictive when classifying PTSD users .
To visualise the effect of age , Figure 1 shows the probability density function in our three populations .
This highlights that PTSD users are consistently predicted older than both controls and depressed users .
This is in line with findings from the National Comorbidity Survey and replications ( Kessler et al ., 2005a ; Kessler et al ., Table 1 : Predictive performance using Logistic Regression in ROC area under the curve ( AUC ) between controls ( C ), depressed ( D ) and PTSD ( P ).
As a consequence , factoring in age in downstream analysis is necessary , as language changes with age on social media .
Figure 1 : Age density functions for each group .
• Gender is only weakly predictive of any mental illness , although significantly above chance in depressed vs . controls ( p < .
01 , DeLong test ).
Interestingly , in this task age and gender combined improve significantly above each individual prediction , illustrating they contain complementary information .
Consequently , at least when analysing depression , gender should ' A non - parametric test for identifying significant differences in ROC curves ( DeLong et al ., 1988 ) Openness Conscientiousness ( a ) Not controlled for age and gender .

be accounted for in addition to age .
• Personality alone obtains very good predictive accuracies , reaching over .
8 ROC AUC for classifying depressed vs . PTSD .
In general , personality features alone perform with strong predictive accuracy , within .
1 of > 5000 unigram features or 2000 topics .
Adding age and gender information further improves predictive power ( C - P p < .
01 , DeLong test ) when PTSD is one of the compared groups .
In Figure 2 we show the mean personality scores across the three groups .
In this dataset , PTSD users score highest on average in openness with depressed users scoring lowest .
However , neu - roticism is the largest separator between mentally ill users and the controls , with depressed having slightly higher levels of neuroticism than PTSD .
Neuroticism alone has an ROC AUC of .
732 in prediction depression vs . control and .
674 in predicting PTSD vs . control .
Controls score higher on extraversion , a trait related to the frequency and intensity of positive emotions ( Smillie et al ., 2012 ).
Controlling for age ( Figure 2b ) significandy reduces the initial association between PTSD and higher conscientiousness , because PTSD users are likely to be older , and conscientiousness tends to increase with age ( Soto et al ., 2011 ).
After controlling , depressed users score lowest on conscientiousness , while PTSD and controls are close to each other .
2 . 82 4 . depressed Mean affect Figure 3 : Users mapped on the emotion circumplex , consisting of affect ( valence ) and intensity ( arousal ).
• Average affect and intensity achieve modest predictive performance , although significant ( C - D p < .
001 , DeLong test ) when one of the compared groups are depressed .
We use the two features to map users to the emotion circumplex in Figure 3 .
On average , control users expressed both higher intensity and higher ( i . e .
more positive ) affect , while depressed users were lowest on both .
This is consistent with the lowered ( i . e .
more negative ) affect typically seen in both PTSD and depressed patients , and the increased intensity / arousal among PTSD users may correspond to more frequent expressions of anxiety , which is characterized by high arousal and lower / negative affect ( American Psychiatric Association , 2013 ).
• Textual features obtain high predictive performance .
Out of these , LIWC performs the worst , while the topics , unigrams and 1 - 3 grams have similarly high performance .
In addition to ROC AUC scores , we present ROC curves for all three binary prediction tasks in Figures 4a , 4b and 4c .
ROC curves are specifically useful for medical practitioners because the classification threshold can be adjusted to choose an application - appropriate level of false positives .
For comparison , we display methods using only age and gender ; age , gender and personality combined , as well as LIWC and the LDA topics .
For classifying depressed users from controls , a true positive rate of ~ 0 . 6 can be achieved at a false positive rate of ~ 0 . 2 using personality , age and gender alone , with an increase to up to ~ 0 . 7 when PTSD users are one of the groups .
When classifying PTSD users , age is the most important factor .
Separating between depressed and PTSD is almost exclusively a factor of age .
This suggests that a application in a real life scenario will likely overpredict older users to have PTSD .
5 Language Analysis The very high predictive power of the user - level features and textual features motivates us to analyse the linguistic features associated with each group , taking into account age and gender .
We study differences in language between groups using differential language analysis - DLA ( Schwartz et al ., 2013 ).
This method aims to find all the most discriminative features between two groups by correlating each individual feature ( 1 - 3 gram or topic ) to the class label .
In our case , age and gender are included as covariates in order to control for the effect they may have on the outcome .
Since a large number of features are explored , we consider coefficients significant if they meet a Bonferroni - corrected two - tailed p - value of less than 0 . 001 .
5 . 1 Language of Depression The word cloud in Figure 5 a displays the 1 - 3 grams that most distinguish the depressed users from the set of control users .
Many features show face validity ( e . g .
' depressed '), but also appear to represent a number of the cognitive and emotional processes implicated in depression in the literature ( American Psychiatric Association , 2013 ).
1 - 3 grams seem to disclose information relating to illness and illness management ( e . g .
' depressed ', ' illness ', ' meds ', ' pills ', ' therapy ').
In some of the most strongly correlated features we also observe an increased focus on the self ( e . g .
' F , ' I am ', ' I have ', ' I haven ' t ', ' I was ', ' myself ') which has been found to accompany depression in many studies and often accompanies states of psychological distress ( Rude et al ., 2004 ; Stirman and Pennebaker , 2001 ; Bucci and Freedman , 1981 ).
Depression classically relies on the presence of two sets of core symptoms : sustained periods of low mood ( dysphoria ) and low interest ( anhedonia ) ( American Psychiatric Association , 2013 ).
Phrases such as ' cry ' and ' crying ' suggest low mood , while ' anymore ' and ' I used to ' may suggest a discontinuation of activities .
Suicidal ideations or more general thoughts of death and dying are symptoms used in the diagnosis of depression , and even though they are relatively rarely mentioned ( grey color ), are identified in the differential language analysis ( e . g .
' suicide ', ' to die ').
Beyond what is generally thought of as the key symptoms of depression discussed above , the differential language analysis also suggests that anger and interpersonal hostility (' fucking ') feature significantly in the language use of depressed users .
The 10 topics most associated with depression ( correlation values ranging from R = .
229 ) suggest similar themes , including dysphoria ( e . g .
' lonely ', ' sad ', ' crying ' - Figures 6b , 6c , 6f ) and thoughts of death ( e . g .
' suicide ' - Figure 6h ).

Figure 5 : The word clouds show the 1 - 3 grams most correlated with each group having a mental illness , with the set of control users serving as the contrastive set in both cases .
The size of the 1 - 3 gram is scaled by the correlation to binary depression label ( point - biserial correlation ).
The color indexes relative frequency , from grey ( rarely used ) through blue ( moderately used ) to red ( frequendy used ).
Correlations are controlled for age and gender .
5 . 2 Language of PTSD The word cloud in Figure 5b and topic clouds in Figure 7 display the 1 - 3 grams and topics most correlated with PTSD , with topic correlation values ranging from R = .
On the whole , the language most predictive of PTSD does not map as cleanly onto the symptoms and criteria for diagnosis of PTSD as was the case with depression .
Across topics and 1 - 3 grams , the language most correlated with PTSD suggests ' depression ', disease management ( e . g .
' pain ', ' pills ', ' meds ' - Figure 7c ) and a focus on the self ( e . g .
' I had ', ' I was ', ' I am ', ' I would ').
Similarly , language is suggestive of death ( e . g .
' suicide ', ' suicidal ').
Compared to the language of depressed users , themes within the language of users with PTSD appear to reference traumatic experiences that are required for a diagnosis of PTSD ( e . g .
' murdered ', ' died '), as well as the resultant states of fear - like psychological distress ( e . g .
5 . 3 PTSD and Depression From our predictive experiments and Figure 4c , we see that language - predicted age almost completely differentiates between PTSD and depressed users .
Consequently , we find only a few features that distinguish between the two groups when controlling for age .
To visualise differences between the diseases we visualize topic usage in both groups in Figure 8 .
This shows standardised usage in both groups for each topic .

This plays the most important role in separating between mentally ill users and controls .
The topics marked by arrows in Figure 8 are some of the topics most used by users with depression and PTSD shown above in Figures 6 - 7 .
Of the three topics , the topic shown in Figure 6h has ' suicide ' as the most prevalent word .
This topic ' s use is elevated for both depression and PTSD .
Figure 6f shows a topic used mostly by depressed users , while Figure 7c highlights a topic used mainly by users with PTSD .
6 Related Work Prior studies have similarly examined the efficacy of utilising social media data , like Facebook and Twitter , to ascertain the presence of both depression and PTSD .
For instance , Coppersmith et al .
( 2014b ) analyse differences in patterns of language use .
They report that individuals with PTSD were significantly more likely to use third person pronouns and significantly less likely to use second person pronouns , without mentioning differences in the use of first person pronouns .
This is in contrast to the strong differences in first person pronoun use among depressed individuals documented in the literature depressed Figure 8 : Topic usage ( z - scored ) for depressed and PTSD users .
Color shows correlation of each topic to neuroticism .
Labeled topics can be found in Figures 6 - 7 .
( Rude et al ., 2004 ; Stirman and Pennebaker , 2001 ), confirmed in prior Twitter studies ( Coppersmith et al ., 2014a ; De Choudhury et al ., 2013 ) and replicated here .
( 2013 ) explore the relationships between social media postings and depressive status , finding that geographic variables can alter one ' s risk .
They show that cities for which the highest numbers of depressive Twitter users are predicted correlate with the cities with the known highest depression rates nationwide ; depressive tweets follow an expected diurnal and annual rhythm ( peaking at night and during winter ); and women exhibit an increased risk of depression relative to men , consistent with known psychological trends .
These studies thus demonstrate the utility of using social media outlets to capture nuanced data about an individual ' s daily psychological affect to predict pathology , and suggest that geographic and demographic factors may alter the prevalence of psychological ill - being .
The present study is unique in its efforts to control for some of these demographic factors , such as personality and age , that demonstrably influence an individual ' s pattern of language use .
Further , these demographic characteristics are known to significantly alter patterns e . g .
pronoun use ( Pennebaker , 2011 ).
This highlights the utility of controlling for these factors when analysing pathological states like depression or PTSD .
7 Conclusions This study presented a qualitative analysis of mental illness language use in users who disclosed their diagnoses .
For users diagnosed with depression or PTSD , we have identified both symptoms and effects of their mental condition from user - generated content .
The majority of our results map to clinical theory , confirming the validity of our methodology and the relevance of the dataset .
In our experiments , we accounted for text - derived user features , such as demographics ( e . g .
age , gender ) and personality .
Text - derived personality alone showed high predictive performance , in one case reaching similar performance to using orders of magnitude more textual features .
Our study further demonstrated the potential for using social media as a means for predicting and analysing the linguistic markers of mental illnesses .
However , it also raises a few questions .
First , although apparently easily predictable , the difference between depressed and PTSD users is largely only due to predicted age .
Sample demographics also appear to be different than the general population , making predictive models fitted on this data to be susceptible to over - predicting certain demographics .
Secondly , the language associated with a self - reported diagnosis of depression and PTSD has a large overlap with the language predictive of personality .
This suggests that personality may be explanatory of a particular kind of behavior : posting about mental illness diagnoses online .
The mental illness labels thus acquired likely have personality confounds ' baked into them ', stressing the need for using stronger ground truth such as given by clinicians .
Further , based on the scope of the applications - whether screening or analysis of psychological risk factors - user - generated data should at minimum be temporally partitioned to encompass content shared before and after the diagnosis .
This allows one to separate mentions of symptoms from discussions of and consequences of their diagnosis , such as the use of medications .
