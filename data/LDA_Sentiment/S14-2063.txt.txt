JU \ _CSE : A Conditional Random Field ( CRF ) Based Approach to Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis The fast upswing of online reviews and their sentiments on the Web became very useful information to the people .
Thus , the opinion / sentiment mining has been adopted as a subject of increasingly research interest in the recent years .
Being a participant in the Shared Task Challenge , we have developed a Conditional Random Field based system to accomplish the Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis task .
The aspect term in a sentence is defined as the target entity .
The present system identifies aspect term , aspect categories and their sentiments from the Laptop and Restaurants review datasets provided by the organizers .
1 Introduction In recent times , the research activities in the areas of Opinion Mining / Sentiment Analysis in natural language texts and other media are gaining ground under the umbrella of subjectivity analysis and affect computing .
The reason may be the huge amount of available text data in Social Web in the forms of news , reviews , blogs , chat and twitter etc .
Majority of research efforts are being carried out for the identification of positive or negative polarity from the textual contents like sentence , paragraph , or text span regardless of the entities ( e . g ., laptops , restaurants ) and their aspects ( e . g ., battery , screen ; food , service ).

Licence details : http :// creativecommons . org / licenses / by / 4 . 0 / http :// www . saaip . org / Aspect is a multinomial distribution over words that represent a more specific topic in reviews ( Jo and Oh , 2011 ).
For example , in case of Laptop reviews , " touchpad " is considered an aspect .
Similarly , given a predefined entity , an aspect term describes a specific aspect of that entity ( e . g ., for the entity " restaurant ", " wine " can be an aspect term ).
Aspect term can be appeared as a single word ( e . g ., " menu ") or multiple words (" side dish ").
It is observed that for a particular entity , one or more number of aspect terms can be grouped into a single category ( e . g ., aspect terms " drinks ", " main course " belongs to the same category , " food ").
The main goal of the Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis ( ABSA ) ( Pontiki et al ., 2014 ) task is to identify the aspect terms and their categories from the given target entities as well as to identify the sentiments expressed towards each of the aspect terms .
The datasets provided by the shared task organizers consist of customer reviews with human - annotations .
We have participated in all of the four tasks .
A combination of Conditional Random Field ( CRF ) based machine learning algorithm and rule based techniques has been adopted for identifying the aspect term , aspect category and their sentiments .
We have used several features like Part of Speech ( POS ), Stanford dependency relations , WordNet information , and sentiment lexicon ( SentiWordNet ) to accomplish these tasks .
The rest of the paper is organized in the following manner .
Section 2 provides the details of previous works .
Section 3 provides an elabora - tive description of the data used in the task .
Features used in these experiments are described in Section 4 .
The detailed setup of experimentation and analysis of the results are described in Section 5 .
Finally , conclusions and future directions are presented .

This approach is generally useful in finding aspects which are strongly associated with a single noun .
But , one principal disadvantage of this approach is that it cannot detect the aspect terms which are of low frequency and noun phrases ( e . g ., different names of dishes like Biryani , Dosa and Uttapam etc .
for the aspect category , " food ").
The proposed work of such problem involves semantic hierarchy , rule - based or combination of both ( Popescu and Etzioni 2005 ).
More recent approaches of aspect detection are based on topic modelling , that use Latent Dirichlet Allocation standard Latent Dirichlet Allocation ( LDA ) is not exactly suitable for the task of aspect detection due to their inherent nature of capturing global topics in the data , rather than finding local aspects related to the predefined entity .
This approach was further modified in Sentence - LDA ( SLDA ) and Aspect and Sentiment Unification Model ( ASUM ) ( Jo and Oh , 2011 ).
Similarly , the identification of focussed text spans for opinion topics and targets were identified in ( Das and Bandyopadhyay , 2010 ).
Snyder and Barzilay ( 2007 ) addressed the problem of identifying categories for multiple related aspect terms appeared in the text .
For instance , in a restaurant review , such categories may include food , ambience and service etc .
In our task , we call them as aspect or review categories .
The authors implemented the Good Grief decoding algorithm on a corpus collected on restaurant review , which outperforms over the famous PRank algorithm ( Crammer and Singer , 2001 ).
Ganu et al ., ( 2009 ) have classified the restaurant reviews collected from City search New York into six categories namely Food , Service , Price , Ambience , Anecdotes , and Miscellaneous .
Sentiment associated with each category has also been identified and both the experiments were carried out using Support Vector Machine classifiers .
Finally , they implemented the regression based model containing MATLAB regression function ( mvregress ) to give rating ( 1 to 5 ) to each review .
http :// people . csail . mit . edu / bsnyder / naacl07 / http :// www . citysearch . com / guide / newyork - ny - metro To determine the sentiment or polarity of the aspect term and aspect category , we need a prior sentiment annotated lexicon .
Several works have been conducted on building emotional corpora in different English languages such as SentiWord - Net ( Baccianella et al ., 2010 ), WordNet Affect ( Strapparava and Valitutti , 2004 ) ( Patra et al ., 2013 ) etc .
Among all these publicly available sentiment lexicons , SentiWordNet is one of the well - known and widely used ones ( number of citations is higher than other resources ) that has been utilized in several applications such as sentiment analysis , opinion mining and emotion analysis .
Several works have been performed on the automated opinion detection or polarity identification from reviews ( Yu and Hatzivassiloglou , 2003 ; Hu and Liu , 2004 ).
Yu and Hatzivass - iloglou ( 2003 ) has focused on characterizing opinions and facts in a generic manner , without examining who the opinion holder is or what the opinion is about .
Then , they have identified the polarity or sentiment of the fact using Naive Bayes classifier .
Hu and Liu , ( 2004 ) has summarized the customer review and then identified the sentiment of that review .
They have achieved promising accuracy in case of identifying polarity of the reviews .
The sentences collected from the customer reviews of Restaurants and Laptops are used in these tasks .
The training data of Restaurant reviews contains 3041 English sentences annotated with aspect terms and aspect categories along with their polarity .
The training data of Laptop reviews contains 3045 sentences annotated with aspect terms along with their polarity .
The test data contains 800 sentences from each of the review sets .
An example extracted from the corpus is as follows : But the staff was so horrible to us .
Here , " staff " is the aspect term and its polarity is " negative ".
The aspect category is " service " and polarity of the aspect category is also " negative ".
http :// citeseerx . ist . psu . edu / index 4 Feature Analysis In general , the feature selection always plays an important role in any machine learning framework and depends upon the data set used for the experiments .
Based on a preliminary investigation of the dataset , we have identified some of the following features .
Different combinations of the features have also been used to get the best results from the classification task .
Parts - of - Speech ( POS ): the aspect terms are basically represented by the noun phrases .
On the other hand , the POS tag plays an important role in aspect term identification ( Hu and Liu , 2004 ; Brody and Elhadad , 2010 ).
Thus , we have used the Stanford CoreNLP tool to parse each of the review sentences to find out the part - of - speech tag of each word and included them as a feature in all of our experiments .
POS Frequency : We have observed that the aspect terms surrounded by a noun or adjective are also denoted as aspect terms .
Therefore , we have utilized this information in our system .
For example , in the phrase " externalJJ mousejNN ".
Here the word " mouse " is an object and aspect term .
The word " external " is also tagged as aspect term .
Before be verb : We have observed that the nouns occur before the " be " verbs denote the aspect terms in most of the cases .
" The hard disk is noisy ".
Here " hark disk " is an aspect term and is followed by the " be " verb " is ".
Inanimate words : In case of the Restaurant and Laptop reviews , we observed that many of the inanimate nouns occur as aspect terms .
We have used the hyponym tree of RiTa .
WordNet to identify the inanimate words .
For example , in the following sentence , the words food , kitchen and menu are inanimate nouns occurred as aspect terms .
" The food is uniformly exceptional , with a very capable kitchen which will proudly whip up whatever you feel like eating , whether it ' s on the menu or not ."
Dependency Relation for finding Object : We have identified the object based dependency relations from parsed sentences , as we have observed that the words occupied in such relations are represented as aspect terms in many cases .
" dobj ", " obj " and " xobj " are considered as the probable candidate relations for identifying the aspect terms .
Here , the Stanford Parser has been used to get the dependency relations .
Ontology Information ( Liu , 2012 ): We have counted the aspect terms in the training data .
The aspect terms occurred more than five times in the corpus are considered during our experiments .
At first , we have tested this ontology information on the development set and observed that the aspect terms with frequency five or more also give better results in the test set .
Sentiment Words : We have used the sentiment words as a feature for the sentiment identification tasks ( Liu , 2012 ; Brody and Elhadad , 2010 ).
Words are identified as positive , negative or neutral using SentiWordNet .
WordNet Information : The RiTa .
WordNet package has been used to extract different properties of the words .
For aspect category identification , we have matched the hypernym tree of each word with the four categories ( service , price , food , and ambience ).
If the hypernym tree does not contain any of such words , we check the next level hy - pernym tree of the words derived from hypernym of previous word .
We have checked up to the second degree hypernym tree .
We also searched hypernym tree of the synset of each word .
Number of Sentence : It has been found that many reviews contain more than one sentence .
Therefore , we have included the number of sentence as a feature based on the output of Stanford Parser .
We have split the output of Stanford Parser by the mark , "( S ".
In case of our experiments , the stop words are excluded .
Total of 329 stop words was prepared manually .
5 Experimentation and Result Analysis We have used the CRF ++ 0 . 58 , an open source tool for implementing the machine learning framework for our experiments .
CRF is well known for sequence labeling tasks ( Lafferty et al ., 2001 ).
Similarly , in the present task , the aspect terms use the context information and are represented in sequences .
Many of the aspect terms are multiword expressions such as " hard disk ".
We have created different templates for different subtasks to capture all the relations between different sequence related features .

Classification of Aspect Term Features used in case of identifying aspect terms are POS , POS Frequency , Before be verb , Inanimate word , objects of the sentence , ontology information .
We have used several rules to identify these features .
Then , we have used the CRF ++ to identify the aspect terms .
Some post processing techniques are also used in order to get better accuracy .
The present system identifies only single word aspect terms .
But it is found in the training data that many aspect terms consist of multiple words .
Therefore , if there is a stop word in between two system identified aspect words , the stop word is also considered as a part of the aspect term .
We have joined the aspect words along with the stop words to form a single but multiword aspect terms .
Precisions , Recalls and F - scores are recorded for our system in Table 1 .
The maximum F - scores achieved in the aspect term identification task for Laptop and Restaurant are 0 . 7455012 and 0 . 84012544 , respectively .
Our system performs better on Restaurant reviews than Laptop reviews .
Table 1 : JU_CSE system result for aspect term identification .
Classification of Aspect Category Features used in this experiment are POS , Dependency relations for object and a few semantic relations of WordNet .
In this subtask , we have also used aspect term knowledge as a feature .
We identified the POS of the words using Stanford CoreNLP tool and used the words which are not listed in our stop - word list .
The objects are identified from the dependency relations .
The hpernym trees of these words are searched up to second degree to find four aspect categories ( service , price , food , and ambience ).
If we don ' t find these four categories in the hypernym tree , we increase the frequency of anecdotes / miscellaneous category .
Frequency counts of these matched words are listed as a feature .
The accuracy of the system for aspect categories in the Restaurant reviews are shown in Table 2 .
Maximum F - score achieved in this aspect category identification is 0 . 8857715 .
The main problem faced in this task was to assign the an - ecdotes / miscellaneous category to the respective reviews .
There are many cases in which the anecdotes / miscellaneous categories occurred with other categories .
In these cases , our system fails to identify the anecdotes / miscellaneous category .
Table 2 : JU_CSE system result for aspect category identification .
We have also observed that every review has at least one category .
If any word of the review does not belong to any of the four categories , we assign these reviews with anecdotes / miscellaneous category at the time of post processing .
c . Classification of Sentiment of Aspect term and category Features used in these experiments are POS , Positive , Negative and Neutral words and number of sentences .
Some reviews with multiple sentences contain different sentiments associated with different aspect terms .
This observation also leads to conflict sentiment .
Therefore , we have also included the aspect term and aspect category information during sentiment identification .
The accuracy of the system is given in the Table 3 .
Table 3 : JU_CSE system result for aspect term and category sentiment identification .
Our system performs moderate in case of sentiment identification .
Mainly , the system was biased towards the positive tags .
It is found that the number of positive tags in the training data was more as compared to others .
We have observed that a conflict tag occurs when an aspect term was present as both positive and negative .
As the present system identifies the sentiment based on word level only , it was unable to detect the conflict tags .
The feature , number of sentences fails to identify the conflict tags .
Therefore , we need to find more suitable features for our system to improve the accuracy .
6 Conclusion In this paper , we have presented a CRF based system for identifying the aspect terms , aspect categories and their sentiments .
We believe that this problem will become increasingly important for common people .
This task will not only be useful to common shoppers , but also crucial to product manufacturers and restaurateurs .
Overall accuracies of our system were moderate .
In future , we will include more suitable features to improve accuracy of our system .
We also intend to explore different machine learning algorithms for these tasks in future .
