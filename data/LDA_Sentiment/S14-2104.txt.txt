Supervised Methods for Aspect - Based Sentiment Analysis In this paper , we present our contribution in SemEval2014 ABSA task , some supervised methods for Aspect - Based Sentiment Analysis of restaurant and laptop reviews are proposed , implemented and evaluated .
We focus on determining the aspect terms existing in each sentence , finding out their polarities , detecting the categories of the sentence and the polarity of each category .
The evaluation results of our proposed methods exhibit a significant improvement in terms of accuracy and f - measure over all four subtasks regarding to the baseline proposed by SemEval organisers .
1 Introduction The increasing amount of user - generated textual data has increased the need of efficient techniques for analysing it .
Sentiment Analysis ( SA ) has become more and more interesting since the year 2000 ( Liu 2012 ), many techniques in Natural Language Processing have been used to understand the expressed sentiment on an entity .
Many levels of granularity have been also distinguished : Document Level SA considers the whole document is about an entity and classifies whether the expressed sentiment is positive , negative or neutral ; Sentence Level SA determines the sentiment of each sentence , some works have been done on Clause Level SA but they are still not enough ; Entity or Aspect - Based SA performs finer - grained analysis in which all entities and This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4 . 0 International Licence .

Licence details : their aspects should be extracted and the sentiment on them should also be determined .
Aspect - Based SA task consists of several subproblems , the document is about many entities which could be for example a restaurant , a laptop , a printer .
Users may refer to an entity by different writings but normally there are not a lot of variations to indicate the same entity , each entity has many aspects which could be its parts or attributes , some aspects could be another entity such as screen of laptop , but most works did not take this case into account .
Therefore , we could define the opinion by the quintuple ( Liu 2012 ) ( ei , aij , sijkl , hk , tl ) where ei is the entity i , aiJare the aspects of the entity i , siJkl is the expressed sentiment on the aspect at the time tl , hkthe holder which created the document or the text .
This definition does not take into account that the entity has aspects that could have also other aspects which leads to an aspect hierarchy , in order to avoid this information loss , few works have handled this issue , they proposed to represent the aspect as a tree of aspect terms ( Wei and Gulla 2010 ; Kim , Zhang et al .
Supervised and unsupervised methods have been used for handling this task , in this paper , we propose supervised methods and test them over two datasets related to laptop reviews and restaurant reviews provided by the ABSA task of SemEval2014 ( Pontiki , Galanis et al .
We tackle four subtasks : 1 .
Aspect term extraction : CRF model is proposed .
Aspect Term Polarity Detection : Multinomial Naive - Bayes classifier with some features such as Z - score , POS and prior polarity extracted from Subjectivity Lexicon ( Wilson , Wiebe et al .
2005 ) and Bing Liu ' s Opinion Lexicon .
Category Detection : Z - score model for category detection has been used .
Category Polarity Detection : The same model proposed for aspect term polarity detection has been adopted .
2 Related works Several methods concerning the ABSA have been proposed , some of them are supervised , and others unsupervised .
The earliest work on aspect detection from on - line reviews presented by Hu and Liu used association rule mining based on Apriori algorithm to extract frequent noun phrases as product features , they used two seed sets of 30 positive and negative adjectives , then WordNet has been used to find and add the seed words synonyms .
Infrequent aspects had been processed by finding the noun related to an opinionated word ( Hu and Liu 2004 ).
Opinion Digger ( Moghaddam and Ester 2010 ) used also Apriori algorithm to extract the frequent aspects then it filters the non - aspects by applying a constraint - learned from the training data - on the extracted aspects .
KNN algorithm is applied to estimate the aspect rating scaling from 1 to 5 stands for ( Excellent , Good , Average , Poor , Terrible ), assuming that the sentiment is expressed by the nearest adjectives to the aspect term in the sentence segment , WordNet is used for finding the synonyms of sentiment word in order to use them to estimate the distance between it and the words of rating scale .
Some unsupervised methods based on LDA ( Latent Dirichlet allocation ) were proposed .
Brody and Elhadad used LDA to find the aspects , determined the number of topics by applying a clustering method ( Brody and Elhadad 2010 ), then they used a similar method proposed by Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown ( Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown 1997 ) to extract the conjunctive adjectives but not the disjunctive due to the specificity of the domain , seed sets were used and assigned scores , these scores were propagated using propagation method through the aspect - sentiment graph building from the pairs of aspect and related adjectives .
Other works make one LDA based model for the aspect and sentiment extraction .
Lin and He ( Lin and He 2009 ) proposed Joint model of Sentiment and Topic ( JST ) which extends the state - of - the - art topic model , Latent Dirichlet Allocation ( LDA ) by adding a sentiment layer , this model is fully unsupervised and it can detect sentiment and topic simultaneously .
Wei and Gulla ( Wei and Gulla 2010 ) modelled the hierarchical relation between product aspects .
They defined SOT Sentiment Ontology Tree to formulate the knowledge of hierarchical relationships among product attributes and tackle the problem of sentiment analysis as a hierarchical classification problem .
Unsupervised hierarchical aspect http :// www . cs . uic . edu /~ liub / FBS / sentiment - analysis . html # lexicon Sentiment model ( HASM ) was proposed by Kim et al ( Kim , Zhang et al .
2013 ) to discover a hierarchical structure of aspect - based sentiments from unlabelled online reviews .
Supervised methods uses normally a CRF or applied a lexicalized HMM model to extract aspects using the words and their part - of - speech tags in order to learn a model , then unsupervised algorithm for determining the aspect sentiment using the nearest opinion word to the aspect and taking into account the polarity reversal words ( such as not ).
CRF model was used by Jakob and Gurevych ( Jakob and Gurevych 2010 ) with these features : tokens , POS tags , syntactic dependency ( if the aspect has a relation with the opinionated word ), word distance ( the distance between the word in the closest noun phrase and the opinionated word ), and opinion sentences ( each token in the sentence containing an opinionated expression is labelled by this feature ), the input of this method is also the opinionated expressions , they use these expressions for predicting the aspect sentiment using the dependency parsing for retrieving the pair aspect - expression from the training set .
Our method for aspect extraction is closed to ( Jakob and Gurevych 2010 ), where we used CRF model with different features for aspect extraction , but another method for sentiment detection .
The second and fourth subtasks are concerning the polarity detection , so besides to all previous discussed works , we can handle them as sentence level SA .
We choose to use Multinomial Naive Bayes with some features ( POS , Z - score , pre - polarity ).
The most related work is ( Hamdan , BÃ©chet et al .
2013 ) where they used Naive Bays with WordNet , DBpedia and SentiWordNet features .
3 The System Our system is composed of four subtasks : 3 . 1 Subtask1 : Aspect Terms Extraction The objective of this subtask is to extract all aspect terms in the review sentence , aspect terms could be a word or multiple words .
For this purpose we have used CRF ( Conditional Random Field ) which have been used for information extraction .
We choose the IOB notation , therefore we distinguish the terms at the Beginning , the Inside and the Outside of aspect term expression .
Then , we propose 16 features , for each term we extract the following features : - Its root ( Porter Stemmer ); - The stemming roots for all three words before and after the term ; - The POS tags for all three words before and after the term ; - A feature indicates if the word starts with capital letter ; - A feature indicates if the word is capitalised .
For example , for this review " But the staff was so horrible to us ."
Where staff is the aspect term , the target of each word will be : But : O the : O staff : B was : O so : O horrible : O to : O us : O .
3 . 2 Subtask2 : Aspect Term Polarity Detection This subtask can be seen as sentence level or phrase level sentiment Analysis , the first step ( 1 ) we should detect the context or the words related to the aspect term , then to compute its polarity according to these words .
Dependency parsing could be used to determine these words or simple distance function .
We extract the context of aspect term according to the syntax and other aspect terms .
Therefore , the context is the term itself and all the surrounding terms enclosed between two separators ( commas in general ), if another aspect is also enclosed by these separators we consider it as a separator instead of the comma , and we do not take the terms after it or before it ( according to its direction to the aspect term ).
If the sentence has only an aspect term the separators will be the beginning and the end of the sentence .
For example , for this review " It took half an hour to get our check , which was perfect since we could sit , have drinks and talk ! "
where we have two aspect terms drinks and check , the context of check will be " It took half an hour to get our check " and the context of drinks will be " have drinks and talk !".
Another example , " All the money went into the interior decoration , none of it went to the chefs ."
The context for interior decoration will be " All the money went into the interior decoration " and the context for chefs will be " none of it went to the chefs ".
The second step ( 2 ) we should determine the polarity , which could be positive , negative , neutral or conflict .
We propose to use Multinomial Naive - Bayes for learning a classifier based on different features : - The terms in the sentence ( term frequency ); - The POS features ( the number of adjectives , adverbs , verbs , nouns , connectors ) - The pre - polarity features ( the number of positive and negative words in the sentence extracted from Subjectivity lexicon and Bing Liu ' s Opinion Lexicon ); - Z - score features ( the number of words which have Z - score more than three in each sentiment class ), Z_score is described in 3 . 3 .
3 . 3 Subtask3 : Category Detection Determining the categories of each sentence can be seen as a multi - label classification problem at sentence level .
We propose to use Z - score which is capable of distinguishing the importance of a term in a category .
The more the term is important in a category the more its Z - score is high in this category and low in other categories in which it is not important .
Thus , we compute the Z - score for all terms using the annotated data , then for each given sentence , the sum of Z - score over each category is computed if the Z - score of term in a category is less than zero , we ignore it in this category because it is not important , the sentence will be attributed to the category having the highest Z - score , if some categories have the same Z - scores the sentence will be attributed to the both .
The algorithm steps : For each tem t in the sentence : We assume that the term frequency follows the multinomial distribution .
Thus , Z_score can be seen as a standardization of the term frequency .
We compute Z score for each term ti in a class Cj ( tij ) by calculating its term relative frequency tfrij in a particular class Cj , as well as the mean ( meani ) which is the term probability over the whole corpus multiplied by nj the number of terms in the class Cj , and standard deviation ( sdi ) of term ti according to the underlying corpus ( see Eq .
( 1 ) Z_score was exploited for SA by ( Zubaryeva and Savoy 2010 ), they choose a threshold ( Z > 2 ) for selecting the number of terms having Z_score more than the threshold , then they used a logistic regression for combining these scores .
We use Z_score as added features for multinomial Naive Bayes classifier .
3 . 4 Subtask4 : Category Polarity Detection We have used Multinomial Naive - Bayes as in the subtask2 step ( 2 ) with the same features , but the different that we add also the name of the category as a feature .
Thus , for each sentence having n category we add n examples to the training set , the difference between them is the feature of the category .
4 Experiments and Evaluations We tested our system using the training and testing data provided by SemEval 2014 ABSA task .
Two data sets were provided ; the first con - tains3Ksentences of restaurant reviews annotated by the aspect terms , their polarities , their categories , the polarities of each category .
The second contains of 3K sentences of laptop reviews annotated just by the aspect terms , their polarities .
The evaluation process was done in two steps .
First step is concerning the subtasks 1 and 3 which involves the aspect terms extraction and category detection , we were provided with restaurant review and laptop review sentences and we had to extract the aspect terms for both data sets and the categories for the restaurant one .
Baseline methods were provided ; Table1 demonstrates the results of these subtasks in terms of precision P , recall R and f - measure F for our system and the baseline .
We remark that our system is 24 % and 21 % above the baseline for aspect terms extraction in restaurant and laptop reviews respectively , and above 3 % for category detection in restaurant reviews .
http :// alt . qcri . org / semeval2014 / task4 / data / uploads / ba selinesystemdescription . pdf task 1 for laptop reviews The second step involves the evaluation of subtask 2 and 4 , we were provided with ( 1 ) restaurant review sentences annotated by their aspect terms , and categories , we had to determine the polarity for each aspect term and category ; ( 2 ) laptop review sentences annotated by aspect terms and we had to determine the aspect term polarity .
Table 2 demonstrates the results of our system and the baseline ( A : accuracy , R : number of true retrieved examples , All : number of all true examples ).
task 2 for laptop reviews We remark that our system is 8 % and 13 % above the baseline for aspect terms polarity detection in restaurant and laptop reviews respectively , and 7 % above for category polarity detection in restaurant reviews .
5 Conclusion We have built a system for Aspect - Based Sentiment Analysis ; we proposed different supervised methods for the four sub - tasks .
Our results are always above the baseline proposed by the organiser of SemEval .
We proposed to use CRF for aspect term extraction , Z - score model for category detection , Multinomial Naive - Bayes with some new features for polarity detection .
We find that the use of Z - score is useful for the category and polarity detection , we are going to test it in another sentiment analysis tasks of another domains .
