The New Eye of Government : Citizen Sentiment Analysis in Social Media Several Governments across the world are trying to move closer to their citizens to achieve transparency and engagement .
The explosion of social media is opening new opportunities to achieve it .
In this work we proposed an approach to monitor and analyze the citizen sentiment in social media by Governments .
We also applied this approach to a real - world problem and presented how Government agencies can get benefited out of it .
1 Introduction Governments across the world facing unique challenges today than ever before .
In recent time , Arab Spring phenomenon is an example of how Governments can be impacted if they ignore citizen sentiment .
It is a growing trend that Governments are trying to move closer to the citizen - centric model , where the priorities and services would be driven according to citizen needs rather than Government capability .
Such trends are forcing the Governments in rethinking and reshaping their policies in citizen interactions .
New disruptive technologies like cloud , mobile etc .
are opening new opportunities to the Governments to enable innovations in such interactions .
The advent of Social Media is a recent addition to such disruptive socio - technical enablers .
Governments are fast realizing that it can be a great vehicle to get closer to the citizens .
It can provide deep insight in what citizens want .
Thus , in the current gloomy climate of world economy today , Governments can reorganize and repriori - tize the allocation limited funds , thereby creating maximum impact on citizens ' life .
Building such insight is a non - trivial task because of the huge volume of information that social media can generate .
However , Sentiment Analysis or Opinion Mining can be a useful vehicle in this journey .
In this work , we presented a model and case study to analyze citizen sentiment from social media in helping the Governments to take decisions .
2 Background 2 . 1 Social Sentiment Analysis The social media is transforming the way we communicate , the way we form relationships , the way we connect to each other , the way we live and work .
Here are some figures that give an idea about the frantic pace in which the social media phenomenon is growing : 1 . 43 billion people worldwide visited a social networking site in 2012 ; nearly 1 in 8 people worldwide have their own Facebook page ; 3 million new blogs come online every month ; and 65 percent of social media users said they use it to learn more about brands , products and services .
Mass Communication expert Curtis ( 2013 ) divided the history of social media into three phases - Before the Dawn ( 1969 - 1993 ), The Dawning ( 1994 - 2004 ) and After the Dawn ( 2005 onwards ).
The works on social sentiment analysis has started to be reported after the last phase commenced , when the social media has received its maturity .
Around 2007 , the researchers and analysts started to take notice of the importance and value of social media monitoring and sentiment analysis as a means to achieve it .
An Aberdeen Group http :// ignitevisibility . com / facebook - marketing / ( Accessed on 6 Jun 2013 ) http :// www . jeffbullas . com / 2012 / 11 / 28 / the - latest - 27 - social - media - facts - figures - and - statistics - for - 2012 - infographic / ( Accessed on 6 Jun 2013 ) http :// www . nielsen . com / us / en / reports / 2012 / state - of - the - media - the - social - media - report - 2012 . html ( Accessed on 6 Jun 2013 ) Benchmark Report ( Zabin and Jefferies , 2008 ) published around same time showed that more than 84 % best - in - class companies improved their overall performance , customer satisfaction , risk management and actionable insights from social media monitoring and analysis .
We found the first publication on social sentiment analysis in a most interesting paper by Abbasi ( 2007 ), where he proposed an affect analysis approach for measuring the presence of hate , violence , and the resulting propaganda dissemination across extremist group forums .
In a similar application , Bermingham et al .
( 2009 ) proposed crawling and analyzing social media sites , such as YouTube , to detect radicalism .
Martineau and Finin ( 2009 ) proposed Delta TFIDF , a new technique to efficiently weight words before classification .
Asur and Huberman ( 2010 ) proposed an approach to predict real - world outcomes through social media sentiment analysis .
Pak and Paroubek ( 2010 ) explored the use of Twitter as a corpus for sentiment analysis .
Bollen et al .
( 2011 ) went ahead and analyzed Twitter content to detect different moods of the microbloggers and linked that with the major events in market , media and culture in time scale .
( 2011 ) discussed the architecture of a tool and proposed a new family of low - rank matrix approximation algorithm on TFIDF model for modelling topics in a given social media corpus .
Tan et al .
( 2011 ) showed that information about social relationship can be used to improve user - level sentiment analysis .
2 . 2 Citizen Social Sentiment Analysis for Government As established in the facts presented in last section , social media presents itself as a ' big data ' source of citizen voice .
If Government agencies can constantly keep a tab on pulse of its citizens , it can pave the way for better governance .
Social sentiment analysis can be a very useful tool to achieve the same .
It can address the following questions which Government agencies would be very interested to get an answer : • How do citizens feel about the agency ' s new programmes and policies ?
• What are the most talked about programmes ?
Is it good or bad ?
• What are the most positively talked about attributes in the agency ' s programmes ?
Can the agency replicate it to other programmes ?
• Is there negative chatter that the agency should respond to ?
• Who are advocates and sceptics of the • Where the agency should be actively listening ?
Answers to such questions would help agencies to fine - tune their policies to address specific concerns ; transform their communication and out - reach programmes to clear any misconceptions ; provide with insights on how its programmes and initiatives are perceived by its key stakeholders ; identify best practices from positively perceived programmes and replicate it in others ; design an effective performance model ; and formulate a comprehensive social business strategy .
Interestingly , while it was well established for more than a decade that commercial organizations can get benefited from sentiment analysis ( Zabin and Jefferies , 2008 ), its value for Governments was not very apparent until recent time .
In 2010 , Gartner came up with Open Government Maturity Model ( Maio , 2010 ).
At 4th level of maturity , Gartner proposed sentiment analysis as a mean to achieve collaboration for Governments .
Echoing to that model , Forrester Research ( Gliedman , 2011 ) observed that the US Federal government was monitoring the citizen sentiment in Twitter .
Gartner ( Maio , 2011 ) advised the Governments to use social media for achieving collaborative budgeting and pattern discovery where citizen sentiment analysis in social media can play a significant role .
The public safety related works ( Abbasi , 2007 ; and Bermingham et al ., 2009 ) we mentioned in section 2 . 1 , can be seen as early sentiment analysis related works for Government .
3 Approach We could not find many publications that reported applying the social sentiment analysis in a Government context .
Thus , it might be an opportune moment to attempt doing a sentiment analysis in the backdrop of a real - life Government problem .
In this section , we proposed an approach to accomplish the same .
3 . 1 Topic Modelling Problem Unlike few other type of content , such as movie review , social media is much unstructured and free flowing .
Thus it is always a challenge to find out documents or entries that are relevant for the topic we are interested in .
This relevance filtering based on topic can be seen as an Information Extraction ( IE ) problem , where a large number of documents or entries in social media are analysed to extract some coherent topics out of it before further analysis for subjectivity detection and sentiment classification .
This problem is called Topic Modelling .
The traditional Term Frequency and Inverted Document Frequency ( TF - IDF ) model , which is used in Information Retrieval ( IR ) for calculating relevance , can be adopted here though with some modification as explained below : Let X G Rn m be the document - term matrix that can be directly used in IR domain , where n = number of documents and m = number of terms .
The elements of X can be defined as ral Language Processing ( NLP ) rules for information extraction from documents .
where tfdw is the term frequency of term w in document d , idfw - log ( n / dfw ), dfw is the document frequency of term w , and Cd is the normalizing factor .
Dimensions of X are expected to be large in social media context though X is expected to be very sparsely populated .
If we want to learn k topics , then let be the matrix of topics and terms .
Similarly , we can imagine as the matrix of topic distribution among documents .
Thus the topic modelling problem can be reduced to be the problem of estimating W and H such that WH « X .
3 . 2 Architecture In our approach , the topic modelling and sentiment analysis is performed by an IBM system - Cognos Consumer Insight ( CCI ).
The architecture of CCI , which runs based on the theoretical foundation above , is presented at Figure 1 .
The components of this system are described below : GPFS : The IBM General Parallel File System is a specialized file system targeted for highperformance applications - such as big data analytics .
Hadoop : Apache Hadoop is an open - source software framework for running data - intensive applications in a distributed fashion over commodity hardware .
SystemT : It is a rule - based IE system as proposed by Chiticariu et al .
It uses a declarative rule language , AQL , to define the Natu - Topic ^\!
( Topic Extractor J [ Modeller Figure 1 : Cognos Customer Insight Architecture FlowManager : Based on the rules and configurations , this component orchestrates the execution of different tasks across different components in this system .
Lucene : Apache Lucene is an open - source framework for IR applications .
AdminUI : The user interface used by administrators to configure this system and define AWL rules using simple interfaces .
AnalysisUI : The user interface component that enables sentiment analysis execution and rendering using Lucene component .
DataFetcher : The social media interfacing component that interacts with diverse sources , fetches information in different formats and produces JSON representation of them and saves into GPFS .
TopicExtractor : With the help of natural language processing rules in SystemT , this component extracts information from JSON data created by DataFetcher .
It computes the tfdw and idfw values and produces X matrix .
This component runs as a Hadoop job .
TopicModeller : This component computes the estimated matrices W and H . It employs the Proximal Rank - One Residue Iterations ( Proxi - mal - RRI ) optimization algorithm as proposed by Sindhwani et al .
It also produces JSON documents annotated with topic information .
This component also runs as a Hadoop job .
Uploader : This component picks up the annotated JSON documents produced by TopicMod - eller and uploads them into a staging area .
Lu - cene indexes these documents so that they can be searched and analysed based on extracted information using traditional sentiment analysis techniques for subjectivity detection and sentiment classification .
3 . 3 Method We propose the three step method below : Step I : Define Analysis Model .
As first step the analysis model needs to be defined and configured through the AdminUI of CCI .
The analysis model comprises of the following : • Query : This defines the scope of baseline data retrieval from social media sources .
The DataFetcher would use it .
The result of the query produces the document dimension ( n ) of the W matrix .
• Topic : As explained earlier , it is important to define topics to bring the free - form large number of documents into a coherent group .
The topics can be configured in CCI in two levels .
A set of Concept terms are defined and those can be grouped into Type .
These topics would be used by the analysis engine to create snippets of interest from the base list of documents retrieved from social media .
For example , if we are analyzing a social services agency , all the benefit programmes such as Income Support , Employment Support can be identified as Concepts and grouped under the Topic ' Benefits '.
This configuration would define the topic dimensions of W and H matrices .
• Hotword : Hotwords are the parameters that are common across the defined topics of interest .
They can provide additional insight into how sentiments around a particular concept can be perceived in the context of different hotwords .
For example , hotword can be a significant process step or a property that is common across multiple Government programmes .
Some of the hotwords for a Social Services agency can be ' Claims ', ' Awareness ' etc .
' Income Support concept can be perceived in a negative sentiment in the context of Claims hotword , but can be perceived in a positive sentiment in the context of Awareness hotword .
• Sentiment Lexicon : Though CCI provides a sentiment lexicon assigned with prior polarity for different languages , it is necessary to validate that in the context of the rest of the analysis model .
This is important since the connotation of a sentiment term can change depending on the context of analysis .
Customisation can be done as necessary .
Step II : Perform Analysis .
After configuration of the analysis model , the tool can be run and analysis can be performed across different dimensions .
Some of them are presented in our Result section .
Step III : Root Cause Analysis .
Once insights from the analysis are gained , a root cause analysis can be carried out .
While this can be done manually by going through all the positive and negative sentiments and analyzing them , there are two ways we can get narrow down the root causes automatically with reasonable accuracy .
• By analyzing the hotwords and their associated overall sentiment that has a closer affinity with a concept .
If a particular aspect has an overall negative sentiment and it has a closer affinity with a programme , then one of the root causes for that particular programme to have a negative sentiment is inefficiencies at that particular aspect of that programme .
• By extracting the Title of all the documents that contain a particular sentiment separately and by doing a tag cloud on the same , we can have some perspective on what discussion item is leading to most of the negative sentiment or a positive sentiment .
3 . 4 Experiment Setup We performed Social Sentiment Analysis for one of the major social benefits organizations in the US .
The scope included : ( a ) analysing agency ' s current social media presence and strategy and compare it with similar agencies in the world ; ( b ) sentiment analysis to understand how agency ' s various benefit and healthcare programs are perceived by citizens ; ( c ) identify root causes leading to the perceptions ; and ( d ) preparing an actionable roadmap based on the findings .
We defined the boundary of our analysis as the user generated content between 1 Jun 2012 and 18 Oct 2012 from Twitter , Facebook , Flickr , YouTube , several blogs , forums and some general websites built around certain community .
BoardReader crawler retrieved 41 , 405 documents based on our configured query and the analysis model extracted 16 , 954 snippets based on the topics defined .
CCI version 1 . 1 was used to run the analysis .
4 Result Results from Sentiment Analysis findings are presented below across various dimensions .
Our interpretations of the results are also highlighted in the sections below .
4 . 1 Sentiment Distribution Across Concepts This analysis is used to compare the perceived sentiments across concepts by citizens .
This can be done at two levels : • including sentiments from snippets that may or may not have hotwords ; and • including sentiments from snippets that has at least one occurrence of a hotword .
The 2nd level gives a much more focused perspective of sentiment analysis since it is relevant to the hotwords of interest .
Figure 2 : Sentiment Distribution Across Concepts ( Regardless of Hotword Presence ) Figure 3 : Sentiment Distribution Across Concepts ( With Hotword Presence ) It is clearly evident that Disability Compensation , Insurance , and Pension contribute heavily towards negative sentiments , whereas Employment Benefits , Dependent ' s Assistance , and Home Loan Benefits are talked in positive light .
4 . 2 Sentiment Distribution Across Hot - words This analysis gives a perspective on how various aspects of agency ' s programmes are perceived .
The analysis is presented in Figure 4 and Figure 5 .
We observed the following : ( a ) Claims and Awareness are mostly associated with Benefits and Services programmes whereas Quality and Helpline are mostly associated with Healthcare programmes ; and ( b ) Claims received most of the negative sentiments . _ I Hotword Distribution Figure 4 : Hotword Distribution Across Concepts Figure 5 : Sentiment Distribution Across Hotwords 4 . 3 Concept - Hotword Affinity Analysis The relationship between Concepts and Hot - words is analyzed by measuring the degree of affinity between these two dimensions .
It helps us derive which aspects of a particular programme lead to a particular sentiment thus giving some hints towards root cause .
Chi - square distribution was used to measure the degree of affinity .
We observed the following : ( a ) Disability Compensation and Pension had a close affinity with Claims , which in turn had a negative sentiment due to high number of backlogs ; ( b ) Suicide and Crisis Prevention had a high affinity with Helpline which had a positive sentiment ; ( c ) Mental Health and other healthcare programmes had high affinity with Quality and were positively perceived ; and ( d ) Many benefit programmes had close affinity with Awareness .
There seemed to lot of out - reach activities done by the agency which boosted the positive sentiment around Awareness .
4 . 4 Root Cause Analysis We performed a root cause analysis with the aid of affinity analysis and formation of tag cloud as shown below : Figure 6 : Tag Cloud We discovered some of the major reasons behind negative sentiments : ( a ) the agency was suffering from huge backlogs in claims processing ; ( b ) awareness of benefits and services was little among its clients and the agency needed to transform its outreach activities ; and ( c ) agency had a poor social media strategy .
This analysis provides key information to draw an actionable roadmap for the agency which can result in reducing negative perceptions and accentuating the positives .
5 Conclusion In this work we chose a particular tool and proposed a method to apply social sentiment analysis in the context of Government .
We went ahead and applied the technique and method to a reallife problem .
In the process of doing so we gained valuable insights , which can be converted into actionable roadmap for the Government .
The success of this application can be taken as an encouragement to apply this approach to more such issues , such as - Lokpal Bill discussion in India or Universal Credit controversy in UK .
Such analysis would be able to provide a conclusive sentimental insight from the mind of the citizens .
Another interesting problem that can be taken up is to apply this method in a multi - lingual country like India , where generating content in a mixture of languages ( e . g .
English and Bengali ) is a common practice in social media .
