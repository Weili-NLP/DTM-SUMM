<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Summary can be generated through extractive methods by ranking and ordering sentences with the aim of maximum coverage, significance, cohesion and minimum redundancy. </a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Generating non-Redundant and more coherent summary is the goal in multi-document summarization (MDS). </a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>MMR approach (Maximal Marginal Relevance) is proposed to reduce redundancy. </a> 
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Summaries can be generic, query-focused, timeline summarization and update summarization. </a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>DualSum and concept-based ILP methods are proposed for update summarization considering the updates regarding the topic .  </a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>LexRank, LexPageRank, Biased-LexRank and Markov Random Walk Model (MRW) are Graph-based methods to weight, rank and select sentences. </a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Statistical feature based approaches deal with features like sentence position, centrality, resemblance, relative length which to extract important sentences and words from source text.   </a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Ouyang proposed an approach in which Regression models are applied for ranking the sentences in query-based summarization of multiple documents. </a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Bayesian topic models labeling sentences or words with topics and selecting sentences that are closely related with query to generate Topic Aspect Oriented Summary. </a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Candidate summaries are compared with human-generated reference summaries by Pyramid and ROUGE measure to evaluate overall summary quality on DUC and TAC conference data set.  </a>
