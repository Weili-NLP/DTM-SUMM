<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Objectives are coverage of information, information significance, redundancy and cohesion in text.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Bayesian topic models such as BayeSum and TopicSum are used in summarization. </a> 
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The centroid-based method is one of  extractive summarization methods.   </a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>MEAD is an implementation of the centroid-based extractive summarization.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Query-focused summarization requires combining query based relevance with information novelty when generating summaries.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>MMR approach (Maximal Marginal Relevance) is suggested for reducing redundancy. </a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Graph-based: LexRank, LexPageRank, Biased-LexRank and Markov Random Walk Model (MRW) are used to weight and rank sentences. </a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>A bi-gram or concept based ILP framework is proposed for selecting sentences by optimizing salience and redundence in extractive summarization.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Performances on DUC and TAC data sets are evaluated by Pyramid method and ROUGE, like ROUGE-N, ROUGE-L,ROUGE-W, ROUGE-S and ROUGE-SU.  </a>
